# IRODKit
Evadne Wu at Iridia Productions, 2011

IRODKit is an experimental collection of code designed in order to simplify app development using the Open Data Protocol on Mac OS X and iOS.  The code is unfinished, unstable, crummy, full of commented-out code and untested execution paths.  Use with caution, unless otherwise assured. :)
